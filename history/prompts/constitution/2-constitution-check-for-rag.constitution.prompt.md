# Constitution Check for RAG Chatbot

## Prompt Text

```
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Response Text

```
I checked the constitution files and confirmed that both the main project constitution and the backend constitution have already been updated to include RAG chatbot functionality for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook. The constitution already contains:

1. Accurate RAG System with Citations principle which specifically addresses the RAG functionality
2. The technology stack includes all necessary components for RAG implementation
3. The acceptance criteria include RAG chatbot functionality

Since the constitution already includes the RAG chatbot functionality that was requested, there were no further updates needed to the constitution file. The current version (1.1.0) already addresses the request for adding a RAG chatbot.
```

## Outcome

Verified that the project constitution already includes RAG chatbot functionality for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook. No additional updates were needed.
