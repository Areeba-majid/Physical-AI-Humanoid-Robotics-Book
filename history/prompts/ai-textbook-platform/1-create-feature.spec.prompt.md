# Feature Specification: AI-native Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook Platform

## Summary
Created comprehensive feature specification for an AI-native textbook platform with RAG chatbot, Urdu translation, personalization, and other interactive learning features.

## Changes Made
- Created detailed feature specification document with user scenarios, functional requirements, and success criteria
- Developed 5 prioritized user stories covering core functionality
- Defined 13 functional requirements with focus on user capabilities
- Established 11 measurable success criteria for feature validation
- Created quality checklist to validate specification completeness

## Key Functional Areas
1. Multi-chapter navigation for textbook content
2. AI-powered RAG chatbot with citation support
3. Text highlighting and context-aware question answering
4. Urdu translation with RTL layout support
5. User authentication and personalization
6. Progress tracking and dashboard
7. AI-generated quizzes and assessments
8. Dark/light mode support
9. WCAG AA accessibility compliance

## Specification Quality
- All implementation details removed from functional requirements
- Requirements are technology-agnostic and user-focused
- Success criteria are measurable and outcome-oriented
- Edge cases properly identified and addressed

## Next Steps
Ready to proceed to architecture planning phase (/sp.plan) to design the system architecture for this feature.

You are an AI expert full-stack developer and UI/UX designer. Your task is to **generate a complete AI-native Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook platform** with a professional, visually appealing UI and optimal user experience. Follow all functional, non-functional, and edge-case requirements. Make sure all outputs are hackathon-ready and deployable. Project Overview: - Full interactive textbook with multi-chapter navigation. - Built-in RAG chatbot with citation support. - Select-text QA (user highlights text to ask questions). - Urdu translation with proper RTL layout. - User personalization based on metadata. - Authentication system (signup/login) and BetterAuth bonus. - User dashboard showing progress and recommendations. - Summaries and quizzes (MCQs + short answer) generated by AI. - Multi-agent architecture with reusable intelligence. - Clean, responsive, modern frontend + backend. UI/UX Requirements: - **Professional typography:** readable, consistent, high contrast. - **Dark/light mode toggle** with smooth transitions. - **Color scheme:** Modern, clean, tech-educational feel (e.g., navy blue, teal, white, gray accents). Use a secondary accent color for interactive elements (buttons, highlights). - **Responsive design:** Desktop, tablet, mobile. Use proper spacing, margins, and fluid grids. - **Interactive elements:** Hover effects on buttons, chapters, links. - **RAG Chatbot:** Floating button, expandable overlay, clean chat bubbles, distinguish user vs AI messages, citations in small italic text. - **Urdu translation:** RTL layout, text alignment correct, proper font for Urdu (Noto Nastaliq or similar). Frontend Stack: - **Docusaurus** for textbook content. - **React + TypeScript** for interactive components. - **Tailwind CSS** for responsive design. - Proper component modularization for chapters, chatbot, dashboard. Backend Stack: - **FastAPI** with proper REST endpoints. - **MongoDB** for user profiles, progress, translation jobs, and quizzes. - **Qdrant Cloud** for embeddings and RAG retrieval. - **Gemini 2.5 Flash** for AI generation (summaries, quiz, chatbot). Multi-Agent Architecture: - **Subagents:** Planning agent, code-generation agent, UI agent, file-writing agent. - Ensure **isolated responsibilities**. - Agents should reuse intelligence across features. Performance Requirements: - Load in < 2 seconds on broadband. - Chatbot latency < 2 seconds. - Support ≥100 concurrent users. - WCAG AA accessibility compliance. Edge Cases: - Empty or non-English text selection → fallback to full RAG. - Urdu translation of code blocks → skip code translation. - Very long chapters → chunk without breaking sentences. - Chatbot question outside textbook → respond politely with limitation. Deliverables: - Complete **frontend + backend code** ready for deployment. - Professional **color-coded, responsive UI**. - Fully functioning **RAG chatbot, Urdu translation, personalization**. - Clean **GitHub repo structure**. - Demo video-ready (< 90 seconds). Special Instructions: - Use **modern, readable fonts** (Roboto, Inter, Noto Nastaliq for Urdu). - Use **consistent spacing, button styles, and color scheme**. - Ensure **all interactive elements** are intuitive and accessible. - Include **comments in code** for maintainability. - Validate all **API endpoints, database models, and UI functionality**. Output Format: - Provide **directory structure**. - Include **code snippets** for key components (frontend, backend, chatbot, dashboard). - Provide **Tailwind CSS color classes and themes**. - Ensure **all links, navigation, and interactive elements** are fully functional. - Provide **sample content for chapters, quiz, summaries**.
