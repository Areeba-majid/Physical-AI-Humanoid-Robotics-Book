# Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine learning (ML) is a type of artificial intelligence that allows software applications to become more accurate at predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning algorithms use historical data as input to predict new output values.

## Supervised Learning

Supervised learning algorithms are trained using labeled examples, which means that the input data is paired with the correct output. This approach is commonly used for classification and regression problems.

## Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning algorithms are used when the data is neither classified nor labeled. The algorithm tries to identify patterns and relationships in the data without prior training.

## Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning concerned with how intelligent agents ought to take actions in an environment to maximize the notion of cumulative reward.
