# Introduction to AI & Robotics

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, in contrast to the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals. Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of "intelligent agents": any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals.

## What is Robotics?

Robotics is an interdisciplinary branch of engineering and science that includes mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, computer science, and others. Robotics deals with the design, construction, operation, and use of robots, as well as computer systems for their control, sensory feedback, and information processing.

## Key Concepts

- Intelligent agents
- Machine learning
- Neural networks
- Automation
- Human-robot interaction

## Applications

AI and robotics have numerous applications across various industries including healthcare, manufacturing, transportation, and service.
