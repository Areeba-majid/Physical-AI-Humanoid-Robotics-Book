# Feature Specification: AI-native Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook Platform

**Feature Branch**: `1-ai-textbook-platform`
**Created**: 2025-12-16
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "You are an AI expert full-stack developer and UI/UX designer. Your task is to **generate a complete AI-native Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook platform** with a professional, visually appealing UI and optimal user experience. Follow all functional, non-functional, and edge-case requirements. Make sure all outputs are hackathon-ready and deployable. Project Overview: - Full interactive textbook with multi-chapter navigation. - Built-in RAG chatbot with citation support. - Select-text QA (user highlights text to ask questions). - Urdu translation with proper RTL layout. - User personalization based on metadata. - Authentication system (signup/login) and BetterAuth bonus. - User dashboard showing progress and recommendations. - Summaries and quizzes (MCQs + short answer) generated by AI. - Multi-agent architecture with reusable intelligence. - Clean, responsive, modern frontend + backend. UI/UX Requirements: - **Professional typography:** readable, consistent, high contrast. - **Dark/light mode toggle** with smooth transitions. - **Color scheme:** Modern, clean, tech-educational feel (e.g., navy blue, teal, white, gray accents). Use a secondary accent color for interactive elements (buttons, highlights). - **Responsive design:** Desktop, tablet, mobile. Use proper spacing, margins, and fluid grids. - **Interactive elements:** Hover effects on buttons, chapters, links. - **RAG Chatbot:** Floating button, expandable overlay, clean chat bubbles, distinguish user vs AI messages, citations in small italic text. - **Urdu translation:** RTL layout, text alignment correct, proper font for Urdu (Noto Nastaliq or similar). Frontend Stack: - **Docusaurus** for textbook content. - **React + TypeScript** for interactive components. - **Tailwind CSS** for responsive design. - Proper component modularization for chapters, chatbot, dashboard. Backend Stack: - **FastAPI** with proper REST endpoints. - **MongoDB** for user profiles, progress, translation jobs, and quizzes. - **Qdrant Cloud** for embeddings and RAG retrieval. - **Gemini 2.5 Flash** for AI generation (summaries, quiz, chatbot). Multi-Agent Architecture: - **Subagents:** Planning agent, code-generation agent, UI agent, file-writing agent. - Ensure **isolated responsibilities**. - Agents should reuse intelligence across features. Performance Requirements: - Load in < 2 seconds on broadband. - Chatbot latency < 2 seconds. - Support ≥100 concurrent users. - WCAG AA accessibility compliance. Edge Cases: - Empty or non-English text selection → fallback to full RAG. - Urdu translation of code blocks → skip code translation. - Very long chapters → chunk without breaking sentences. - Chatbot question outside textbook → respond politely with limitation. Deliverables: - Complete **frontend + backend code** ready for deployment. - Professional **color-coded, responsive UI**. - Fully functioning **RAG chatbot, Urdu translation, personalization**. - Clean **GitHub repo structure**. - Demo video-ready (< 90 seconds). Special Instructions: - Use **modern, readable fonts** (Roboto, Inter, Noto Nastaliq for Urdu). - Use **consistent spacing, button styles, and color scheme**. - Ensure **all interactive elements** are intuitive and accessible. - Include **comments in code** for maintainability. - Validate all **API endpoints, database models, and UI functionality**. Output Format: - Provide **directory structure**. - Include **code snippets** for key components (frontend, backend, chatbot, dashboard). - Provide **Tailwind CSS color classes and themes**. - Ensure **all links, navigation, and interactive elements** are fully functional. - Provide **sample content for chapters, quiz, summaries**."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Access Interactive Textbook Content (Priority: P1)

As a student or researcher, I want to navigate through a comprehensive AI and robotics textbook with multiple chapters, sections, and interactive elements so that I can learn about complex concepts effectively.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational functionality that delivers the core value of the platform - providing educational content in an accessible format.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by loading textbook chapters, navigating between sections, and verifying content displays correctly in both light and dark modes across different device sizes.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user accesses the platform, **When** they navigate to any chapter, **Then** the content should load within 2 seconds with proper formatting, typography, and responsive design
2. **Given** user is reading a chapter, **When** they switch between light and dark modes, **Then** the colors should change smoothly with a transition effect

### User Story 2 - Ask Questions via RAG Chatbot (Priority: P1)

As a learner, I want to ask questions about the textbook content and receive accurate answers with proper citations so that I can clarify concepts and deepen my understanding.

**Why this priority**: The RAG chatbot is a core feature that enables interactive learning, which is essential to the platform's value proposition.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by querying the chatbot with questions related to textbook content and verifying that responses are accurate, timely (<2 seconds), and include proper citations to the source material.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user has textbook content loaded, **When** they ask a question via the chatbot, **Then** the system should provide an accurate answer with citations within 2 seconds
2. **Given** user highlights text and asks a related question, **When** they submit the query, **Then** the chatbot should provide context-aware responses based on the highlighted content

---

### User Story 3 - Access Content in Urdu with RTL Support (Priority: P2)

As a Urdu-speaking learner, I want to access textbook content and interact with the platform in Urdu with proper right-to-left text layout so that I can have an inclusive learning experience.

**Why this priority**: Providing Urdu translation demonstrates the platform's commitment to accessibility and global reach, which is specifically mentioned in the requirements.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by switching to Urdu language, verifying RTL text alignment, proper font rendering, and ensuring all interactive elements work correctly in RTL layout.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user selects Urdu language, **When** they view textbook content, **Then** text should be properly aligned with RTL layout and appropriate font
2. **Given** user is in Urdu RTL mode, **When** they interact with UI elements, **Then** the layout should remain properly aligned and functional

### User Story 4 - Personalized Learning Experience (Priority: P2)

As a registered user, I want the platform to personalize content based on my learning progress, preferences, and metadata so that I receive relevant recommendations and adaptive learning paths.

**Why this priority**: Personalization enhances user engagement and learning outcomes, making the platform more valuable than static textbooks.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a user profile, tracking their progress, and verifying that recommendations and dashboard content adapt to their learning behavior.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user has completed certain chapters, **When** they visit the dashboard, **Then** they should see personalized recommendations based on their progress
